# lunapi

_lunapi_ is the Python interface to Luna.  We will expand this page to
provide a more integrated description of _lunapi_ in the future,
e.g. explcitly mapping command-line options to Python functions.

In the mean time, please see these pages for details on how to install and use Luna via Python:

 - [Installation](https://github.com/remnrem/luna-api-notebooks?tab=readme-ov-file#lunapi-a-python-interface-for-luna)

 - [Example JupyterLab notebooks](https://github.com/remnrem/luna-api-notebooks/blob/main/00_overview.ipynb)

 - [Tutorial](https://github.com/remnrem/luna-api-notebooks/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb)
 
 - Scope interactive viewer - _page to be added_

All core Luna commands used in _lunapi_ are identical to the basic
Luna library commands described [here](../ref/index.md).  Also, many
of the fundamental options described [here](../luna/args.md) also
apply to _lunapi_.
