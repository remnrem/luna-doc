## v0.25 (XX-December-2020)

- added `Eigen` support for `ICA`

- added `ADJUST` command

- added annot output for SOAP-SUDEs and spindles

- added `MS`

- added `regional` MASK

- added `force-edf` option to `WRITE` to force writing as EDF (from EDF+)

make separate REF type (A1, A2, M1, M2)

now HEADERS respects `sig` option, some changes to variable output names

fix mkdir WRITE for Windows

ANON - EDF+ happiness

--build  - option to add quotes around --build options if they contain spaces

TLOCK

_Channel/epoch masking_

- the new `CHEP-MASK` command replaces the outlier detection/masking
  previously performed via `SIGSTATS`.  Now, `SIGSTATS` only reports
  statistics (e.g. Hjorth, etc).

- the `CHEP-MASK` function has three main arguments

`ep-th`, `ch-th` and `chep-th` (along with versions `ep-th0`, `ch-th0` and `chep-th0`
- new CHEP functions (channels, epochs); logger output
- SIGSTATS no longer performs mask
- INTERPOLATE now clears interpolated CHEPs

_Annotation file format_

- changed .annot format
 +dur
 0+hh:mm:ss offset
 six tab cols
 channel label
 header
 changed hh:mm:ss input (off-by-one for duration)
 now fully allow 0-duration annotations [a,a) 
 
- changed `.annot` file format, now fixed for five columns;  also added '+' support
  and fixed WRITE-ANNOTS output to be consistent

- allow '...' in the second field of an .annot file, meaning that annotation spans
  until the start of the next one (or the end of the EDF), e.g. for use with EDF+ Hypnogram
  files that only specify the start of each signal

- note: in imports, all times are limited to 1/1000th resolution to
  avoid floating point issues being scaled up

- added `sec-dp=N` option to control second DP in .annot output


_Major new functionality_

- new output for the `HYPNO` command: 
 - stage transition counts and probabilities, with `PRE` and `POST` factors; also with conditional probabilities `P_PRE_COND_POST` and `P_POST_COND_PRE`
 - now outputs epoch-level stage transition information in full and with different naming scheme: `TR_NR2REM`, etc and `TOT_NR2REM` 
 - `FLANKING_MIN` and `FLANKING_ALL` instead of `FLANKING_SIM`
 - option `flanking-collapse-nrem`  (default T), i.e. flank based on any NREM stage (1, 2  or 3)
 - option `req-pre-post`, to only consider stage transitions that have `FLANKING_ALL` >= x for the `POST` stage; defaults to 4 (2 mins)

- added support for __principal spectral components (PSC) analysis__:
  command-line `--psc` to build PSC models given output from PSD and/or
  COH (i.e. CH/F stratified output for PSD or CSPEC); also the `PSC`
  command to apply an existing model (generated by `--psc`) to new
  signals

_Misc fixes/additions_

- `fac` instead of `bin` for PSD 
  
- for `SIGNALS` command, added the `req` option to _require_ that specified signals are present/kept; in contrast, the
original `keep` option now will not complain if a requested signal is not present (i.e. `keep` implies keep if present)

- added the `id` command-line option, so that a numeric ID can be
  specified (i.e. and not be interpreted as a sample-list line number)

- added the `ids` command-line option to supply an ID mapper [ old ->
  new , tab-delim file ]; this can be used with the `ANON` to set the
  EDF header IDs

- added the `root` option to the `ANON` command, to specify "dummy"
  IDs, in the form `root_N` where `N` is 1, 2, 3, etc. As the `N`
  count is always from 1 for a given run of luna, this can be
  inconvenient if splitting a sample-list and running in parallel:
  thus the `ids` option as above is also given.


- added a `min` option to `EPOCH`, which gives minimal output: just the EPOCH count to standard output

- added `guess` (and `eeg`) options to the `CANONICAL` command, to guess `cs_EEG` without a file/group specified


_Internal_

- added `cache_t` for `PSC` command `SPINDLES`/`SO`, and adding a `COUPL` command

- Luna now trims trailing whitespace from the __physical dimension__
  and __transducer type__ fields in an EDF header. (This was already
  done for channel labels).

- added a runs-test to stats


## v0.24 (22-August-2020)


_New commands_

 - [`ALIASES`](ref/summaries.md#aliases) command to list any channel/annotation aliases done for that individual

 - [`MINMAX`](ref/manipulations.md#minmax) command to set EDF header digital/physical min/max
   to same values across multiple channels

 - [`TYPES`](ref/summaries.md#types) command and accompanying options `ch-match`, `ch-exact` and
   `ch-clear`, which groups channels by [_types_](luna/args.md#channel-types) (e.g. EEG, EMG,
   respiratory effort, etc) and defines correspondong automatic
   variables (e.g. `${eeg}` and `${emg}`); the `HEADERS` command
   now also outputs a `TYPE` field

 - [`CANONICAL`](ref/manipulations.md#canonical) command to generate _canonical signals_,
   `cs_EEG`, `cs_LOC`, `cs_ROC`, `cs_EMG` and `cs_ECG` 

 - [`VARS`](ref/summaries.md#vars) command to output all variables defined for a given
   individual (designed to be paired with the new individual-level
   variables feature, via the [`vars`](luna/args.md#individual-variables)
   option)

 - [`CC`](ref/cc.md#cc) command for connectivity and coupling statistics 

 - [`ACF`](ref/power-spectra.md#acf) command to calculate signal autocorrelation
 

_New options/behaviors for existing commands_

 - added `SENS` and `POS` variables to [`HEADERS`](ref/summaries.md#headers) channel-level output
 
 - added `flat` and `max` options to [`SIGSTATS`](ref/summaries.md#sigstats)

- [`CWT-DESIGN`](ref/power-spectra.md#cwt-design) now outputs FWHM in
   time and frequency domains, and accepts newer FWHM-basewd
   specification (instead of cycles); see [this
   manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/397182v1.full.pdf)
     
 - added the `wrapped` and `fwhm` options to [`CWT`](ref/power-spectra.md#cwt)
 
 - added the `fft` option to [`FILTER`](ref/fir-filters.md#filter) for FFT convolution

 - [`FILTER`](ref/fir-filters.md#filter) and [`FILTER-DESIGN`](ref/fir-filters.md#filter-design)
   can now read a FIR from a `file`; also, 
   instead of Kaiser windows to design a FIR, one can now fix the
   filter order and specify the type of window (e.g. Hamming, Blackman, etc)

- added a `new` option for the [`REFERENCE`](ref/manipulations.md#reference) command, and the ability
  to specify `.` as a reference (i.e. to do nothing, to facilitate
  automatic processing)

 - added summaries to [`CORREL`](ref/cc.md#correl), and improved the speed of this command

- allow now a comma-delimited list when defining stage labels for
  [`STAGE`](ref/hypnograms.md#stage) and [`HYPNO`](ref/hypnograms.md#hypno), e.g. `N1=n1,NREM2`

 - added `epoch` and `per-spindle` options to the [`SPINDLES`](ref/spindles-so.md#spindles),
   making this level of output optinal, and omitted by default (i.e. for `E`x`F`x`CH` and `N`x`F`x`CH`) 

 - new added `cstats` and `astats` options for [`SIGSTATS`](ref/summaries.md#sigstats)

 - added the `channels` option to the [`DESC`](ref/summaries.md#desc) command
   (to write a simple list of all channel labels to standard output)

 - the `ANNOTS` command now outputs `START_HMS`/`STOP_HMS` and `START_ELAPSED_HMS`/`STOP_ELAPSED_HMS`
   under `ANNOT` x `INST` x `T` output strata, which are the _hh:mm:ss_ version of clock-time and elapsed
   time since EDF start, respectively

_Other changes_

 - default log output is now less verbose (unless `verbose=1` set)
 
- small fixes in processing EDF fields: the reserved field is now set
   to space (rather than null) characters; also, all EDF header fields
   (including the reserved field) are now checked for being within the
   7-bit US-ASCII range 32-126 (any character outside this range is
   changed to a `?` character)

 - changed behavior to replace [spaces in channel names](luna/args.md#spaces-in-channel-names)
   with underscore (`_`) characters for ease of processing; setting the `spaces` variable
   can specify alternate replacement characters; `keep-spaces` option, if true,
   means that spaces are retained 
 
 - added support for individual-level variables to be loaded from a file
   (via the [`vars`](luna/args.md#individual-variables) option)

 - added automatic [special variable `${id}`](luna/args.md#individual-variables),
   which can act in the same manner as the `^` special
   character in scripts, i.e. to represent the current EDF ID

 - added the `add=` option to turn on/off conditional blocks

 - added a check that any variable defined in a script does not clash
   with a special variable (i.e. command line _option_).

 - added `include={file list}` option, to mirror `exclude={file list}`
 (nb. you cannot have both exclude and include)
 
 - Luna can now read gzipped (compressed) ASCIIs directly

 - added a check that named `TAG`s do not clash with existing,
   internal tags, e.g. `F` or `CH`

 - fixed an issue with 0-duration annotations, e.g. as may occur with
   _marks_ from `EDF Annotations` channel

 - fixed an issue with the `ANNOTS` command not reporting all output
   if the `EPOCH` command hadn't been explicitly called first

 - Luna now explicitly gives an error message if trying to use an
   `.eannot` file (or `e:1` notation in an `.annot` file) with EDF+
   (i.e. which may be discontinuous).  That is, if the input file is
   an EDF+, Luna requires annotation formats with exact times
   (i.e. either seconds elapsed since the start of the EDF, or
   _hh:mm:ss_ format).
 
- added [EDF+ Annotation parsing](ref/annotations.md#luna-annotations);
  Luna now reads all `EDF Annotations`
  events as an annotation track, which is automatically combined with
  any other annotations (e.g. from XML or `.annot` files).  Currently,
  all annotations have the class `edf_annot`, which values are
  instance IDs/label. 

 - added new options to [force/skip annotations](luna/args.md#other-annotation-options):
 `force-edf`, `skip-annots`, `skip-edf-annots` and `skip-all-annots`.

 - added support for using braces `{` and `}` instead of `'` to denote string literals in _eval_ expressions
 (i.e. which can be convenient if writing expressions on the command line with `-s` where `'` is already
 used)
 
- changed formatting of `-t` [text table](luna/args.md#text-tables) file names;
  added `--tt-prepend` and `--tt-append` options (equivalently, `--tt-prefix` and `--tt-suffix`)


## v0.23 (15-Jan-2020)

 - new __help function__ ([`-h` command line
   argument](luna/args.md#help)), to list commands, parameters and
   their output tables/variables

 - new __spindle/slow oscillation coupling [permutation
   option](ref/spindles-so.md#)__ and output variables

 - provisional support for [__text-table output__](luna/args.md#text-tables) mode with `-t` option,
   optionally writing gzipped text (with corresponding _lunaR_
   [`ltxttab()`](ext/R.md#ltxttab) function

 - new option to __read data from a__ [__plain text
   file__](luna/args.md#plain-text-input) rather than an EDF

 - __automatically generate sample lists__
   with a new [__--build__](luna/args.md#-build-option) option, i.e. to
   recursively find all EDFs and match annotation files in a set of
   folders

 - added support to __read and write compressed EDF files__, via the
   [EDFZ](luna/args.md#edfzs) format, as highlighed in [this
   vignette](vignettes/edfz.md)

 - __new scripting features:__ command files now allow [_conditional
clauses_](luna/args.md#command-files), via the `[[var`  syntax, [_within-script variable
definitions_](luna/args.md#variables), via the `${var=xyz}`syntax, and [expanding numeric
sequences](luna/args.md#variables), e.g. `[ICA][1:10]` expands to
`ICA1,ICA2,ICA3,...`

 - new [`SEGMENTS`](ref/outputs.md#segments) command to show contiguous time intervals within a discontinuous EDF+

 - can now [write EDF+ files](ref/outputs.md#write)

 - new _experimental_ commands for __multi-channel EEG__:
[`CLOCS`](ref/cc.md#clocs) (to read channel locations), 
[`CHEP`](ref/cc.md#chep) (channel/epoch masks), 
[`INTERPOLATE`](ref/cc.md#interpolate) (to interpolate missing channels/epoch based on spherical splines), 
[`SL`](ref/cc.md#sl) (to compute the surface Laplacian), and 
[`ICA`](ref/cc.md#ica) (implementation of the fastICA algorithm).

 - added individual-ID wildcards in the specification of output
   database names (`-o` or `-a`), i.e. to write to a separate database
   for each EDF/individual, e.g. `-o path/to/out-^.db`

 - [`COH`](ref/cc.md#coh) performance has
   increased, and it now reports imaginary and lagged coherence; also,
   can accept `sig1` and `sig2` parameters to more flexibly specify
   which pairs of channels are considered

 - the `CHS` output factor is now split into two separate factors, `CH1` and `CH2`, for `COH` `CORREL` and `MI`

 - added [`SPANNING`](ref/annotations.md#spanning) command to report on
   "coverage" of an EDF by one or more annotations

 - added special variables `silent` to turn off all console logging
 
 - added `--xml2` command line option for verbose view of XML tree

 - removed the `skip-annots` special variable; replaced with two new
   variables: `skip-edf-annots` and `skip-all-annots`

 - the [`MASK`](ref/masks.md#mask) `epoch` and `mask-epoch` parameters
   can now take comma-delimited lists of ranges,
   e.g. `epoch=1,6,8-10,22`

 - changed the behavior of
   [`assume-pm-start`](luna/args.md#force-evening-start-time); it is now off by
   default, and accepts a time parameter to define whether ambiguous
   times are assigned AM or PM values

 - added `START_TIME`, `START_DATE` and (optionally) `SIGNALS` output
   variables to the [`HEADERS`](ref/summaries.md#headers) command
 
 - now make new, unique labels for any duplicate channel labels found
   in an EDF (e.g. EEG, EEG.1, EEG.2, etc) and writes a message to the
   log

 - now check whether the same channel _alias_ points to more than one
   channel, and if so, will give an error message

 - can now use _hh:mm:ss_ clock-time format in `.annot` files (assumes
   24 hour; requires start & stop specified)

 - changed clock-time format from `hh:mm:ss` to `hh.mm.ss` for
   compliance with the EDF spec; Luna can still read clock-times with
   the colon-delimiter however

 - new mode (`-a` instead of `-o`) to append to, rather than overwrite, output databases

 - fixed an issue with the `MTM` command's `epoch` option, when used with
   multiple signals

 - fixed issue with command parameters not being recorded in the output
   database

 - added the `nsrr-remap` option to turn off [auto-remapping of NSRR
   annotations](nsrr.md#annotation-aliases)

 - new [`RECS`](ref/outputs.md#recs) and [`SEGMENTS`](ref/outputs.md#segments) commands to dump basic EDF record
   and interval info to stdout

 - added a `fail-list` option [note: _need to check implementation_]

 - fixed issue with `ANNOTS` where an annotation was flagged as
   overlapping a region/epoch is it ended exactly 1 time-unit
   beforehand (i.e. ignored convention that intervals are internally
   represented as [start] to [one past the end] of the interval).
