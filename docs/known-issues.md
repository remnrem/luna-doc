# Known issues

- although we should be able to read gzipped-compressed plain text

  need to fix

- check/document that `SPINDLES` command can use `fwhm` parameterization

- empirical threshold setting for `SPINDLES` appears broken in v0.24

- documentation: need to document new `FILTER` features, e.g. taking a `file`, etc
