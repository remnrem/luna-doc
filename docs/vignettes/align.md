# Aligning independent recordings

- basic downsampling, relabelling
- staging (POPS)
- viz. (Moonlight)
- spindles / spectral

- INSERT / XCORR align
-  time stretch ... [impl]

- make new EDFs
- spectral/coherence

- SPINDLES
  - titrate param --- OVERLAP metrics as 'gold standards' 
- overlap

 200    400    600     800     10000 
 300    600    900

 200    400    600    800    1000
     300       600       900

 900 -> 600 

s1 = 900, s2 = 600
*assuming* the same nominal SR, we want fewer samples (2/3 as much)
 as this does not last as long as suspects...
