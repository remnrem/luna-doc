# Command Reference

These pages describe the Luna command language, which can be used
either via the terminal-based [_lunaC_](../luna/args.md) tool or the R
extension library [_lunaR_](../ext/R.md).  Under each section, we tabulate the
relevant _commands_, along with their input _parameters_ and output
_variables_.  We give examples using a mixture of [_lunaC_](../luna/args.md) 
and [_lunaR_](../ext/R.md). Also see _lunaC_'s [help function](../luna/args.md#help).
