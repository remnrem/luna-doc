<p align="right"><em>Current Luna release: <b>v0.27</b> (27-Sep-2022)</em></p>

## Installation options 

Luna is released under the
[GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license,
allowing free sharing and modification of the source code.  There are
three basic ways to obtain Luna:

- [source code](source.md) for _lunaC_ and _lunaR_, along with
  instructions for compilation

- [binary executables](exec.md) for _lunaC_ for Mac OS and Windows

- or as a [Docker container](docker.md), which allows any machine with
  [Docker](http://www.docker.com) installed on it to run Luna (both
  _lunaC_ and _lunaR_) and comes with R (and RStudio) and the tutorial data pre-installed.


!!! hint "Advice for Linux"
    For most up-to-date Linux distributions, we recommend pulling the
    [source](source.md) and compiling directly.

!!! hint "Advice for Mac OS"
    For most Mac users, we recommend downloading the [binaries](exec.md) 
    or using the [Dockerized](docker.md) version.
 
!!! hint "Advice for Windows" 
    For Windows, we recommend using the
    [Dockerized](docker.md) version of Luna to provide a complete
    environment in which Luna can operate best.  Currently, it is the only way that you can use _lunaR_ on Windows too.


## Data resources

The [data](data.md) page contains a number of resources that can be
used with Luna on any platform, namely the [tutorial data](../tut/tut1.md)
and resources to support working with [NSRR data](../nsrr.md).

## Changelog and known issues

For recent changes and additions in the latest version, see the [CHANGELOG](../updates.md) page.
