# Luna web apps

We have built web-based applications on top of Luna, primarily:

 - [Moonlight](moonlight.md) - an interactive browser tool for interactive viewing and analysis of a single recording

 - [Moonbeam](moonbeam.md) - an extension to Moonlight that enables NSRR users to directly pull NSRR data into Moonlight

 - [Hypnoscope](hypnoscope.md) - a tool for viewing many hypnograms, with different options to sort, align and filter
